# toastmasters-agenda
A slack bot to post the current agenda for each meeting to a channel


You need to install chrome for testing binary AND driver to use this script. (These are two separate zip files. I used v131.0.6778.85 when writing this.) 


Find downloads here : https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/


Once you have installed the required files, create a directory named "[text](chrome-for-testing)" at the same level of current_agenda.


Move the unzipped contents of chrome for testing BINARY,  AND  then unzipped DRIVER contents to the directory you created.
